Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe. As such, they are important probes of universal constants such as the dark matter and baryon densities.

I worked under Dr. John ZuHone at Harvard to analyze the physics within galaxy cluster mergers. In particular, we focused on characterizing the magnetic field within cluster cores throughout a merger. We used magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using FLASH with 9 different orientations of cluster mass ratios and impact parameters (motivated by actual observations).
