Hi! My name's Bryan, and I'm a first-year Astrophysics Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.

I graduated from Harvard in May 2018, with a B.A. in Astrophysics and Physics, cum laude in field. For my undergraduate thesis project, I worked with Dr. John ZuHone on investigating the effect of magnetic fields on gas dynamics in the cores of galaxy cluster mergers by using magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

Currently, I am working with Dr. Andrew Siemion and [Breakthrough Listen](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/) to search for ISM-scintillated narrow band signals in radio time-frequency data with convolutional neural networks.

My research interests lie in machine learning, image classification, and numerical simulations.

Outside of research, I enjoy music production and writing my own songs, primarily with Logic Pro X. I also enjoy working on various personal coding projects (see [Code](/code/)!).
