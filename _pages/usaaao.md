The USA Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition Foundation (USAAAO) is a non-profit organization which organizes a national team of high school students to compete in the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA). For our team selection process, we hold national astrophysics competitions and an invitational preparatory camp at MIT.
